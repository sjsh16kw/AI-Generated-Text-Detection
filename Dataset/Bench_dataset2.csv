The rise of ebooks and tablets has sparked a debate about the future of traditional newspapers and magazines. While digital formats offer undeniable advantages, it's unlikely they'll completely replace print media.

Ebooks and tablets boast significant convenience. They're lightweight and portable, allowing you to carry a vast library and access new content instantly. They often offer adjustable font sizes for a more comfortable reading experience. Additionally, digital subscriptions and purchases can be cheaper than physical copies, especially in the long run. E-readers also promote a greener approach by eliminating the need for paper printing and distribution. News websites and apps keep you constantly updated with the latest news.

However, traditional newspapers and magazines offer unique benefits. Many people enjoy the physical experience of holding a publication, feeling the texture of the pages, and turning them. Print media can also provide a more focused reading experience compared to digital devices with notifications and distractions.  Magazines offer curated content, where you get a selection of articles related to your interests, reducing the chance of getting pulled into unrelated online content.  Some people also perceive established newspapers and magazines as more trustworthy sources of information.

Therefore, the future will likely see a coexistence of both formats. The ease of use and constant updates of digital formats will likely continue to attract users. However, there will probably always be a place for the unique experience and perceived reliability of print media. People will likely choose their preferred format depending on the situation and their personal preferences.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"Technology is flourishing by leaps and bounds and providing us with new avenues while keeping us updated with the latest news and current affairs. Therefore, a fair amount of people believe, a conventional way of newspaper reading will be disappeared. I do not completely agree with it because a conventional newspaper is the easiest and cheapest way to get news.

To embark on, there are multiple reasons why the traditional ways of getting news are still popular. First of all, reading the newspaper has become the ardent habit of many people. Everyone whether from the affluent or middle class is seen desperately waiting for paper in the morning and enjoying it reading with a cup of tea. Moreover, these are the most portable, cheapest, and easiest ways of knowing about global activities. It can be carried from one place to another in the bag and is available at an economical price. It is so handy and merely continuing the flip of pages can make you omniscient. Secondly, electricity and other appliances are not required. Moreover, the other attachments are like icing on the cake. For instance, the Hindustan Times has multiple attachments like women’s fashion, career guides, culinary art, and so on.

However, undoubtedly, technology has given a radical approach to reading news, for example, videos provide a full and clear view of reading Besides that we can download, share, and forward them to our relatives and friends. Needless to say, technophobia will have no place in this ever-advanced modern world.

To conclude, the lives of people are drastically affected by advanced versions of technology yet, in my opinion, it will not be able to pose a threat to the existence of traditional newspapers and magazines.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"There's a growing idea that teenagers should be required to volunteer in their communities. While mandatory service has potential benefits, it's important to consider both sides of the issue.

Proponents of mandatory service argue that it can help teenagers develop valuable skills and a sense of social responsibility.  Volunteering can expose teens to different careers and social issues, and it can teach them teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.  Regular volunteer work can also give teens a sense of purpose and accomplishment, fostering a connection to their community.

However, critics argue that mandatory service can be counterproductive.  Teens with busy schedules or limited interests might find forced volunteer work to be a chore, reducing the potential benefits.  Additionally, some worry that mandatory service programs could exploit teens' free time and take away from other important activities like academics or extracurriculars.

Perhaps a more effective approach would be to focus on expanding and promoting existing volunteer opportunities for teens.  Schools and community organizations can work together to create engaging volunteer programs that match teens' interests and schedules.  This approach would allow teens to choose meaningful service and reap the benefits of volunteering without feeling forced.

Ultimately, the goal is to encourage teens to become active and engaged members of their communities.  Whether through mandatory service or voluntary programs, creating opportunities for teens to give back can be a positive force for both the teens and the community.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"Children are the backbone of every country. So, there are people who tend to believe that youngsters should be encouraged to initiate social work as it will result in a flourished society and individualistic growth of youngsters themselves. I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.

To begin with,  social work by children can be easily associated with personality development because, during this drive, they tend to communicate with a variety of people, which leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children to school they have to have a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kinds of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance, patience, team spirit, and cooperation can be learned. Besides that, young minds serve the country with full enthusiasm giving the feeling of fulfillment and self-satisfaction. This worthiness for themselves brims them with self-confidence and patriotic feeling. Moreover, going and experiencing multiple cultures and traditions makes their horizon so broad that add one more feather to their cap.

However, It is truly said, no rose without thrones. Can the drawbacks of this initiation be ignored? Children go to school, participate in different curriculum activities, and endure the pressure of peers, parents, and teachers, and in the competitive world, they should not be expected to serve society without their self-benefits. This kind of pressure might bring resentment in their mind.

In conclusion, I believe, the notion of a teenager doing unpaid work is indeed good but proper monitoring and care should be given to avoid untoward consequences.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"Many parents grapple with the question of how to encourage good behavior in their children.  Two common approaches are punishment, often physical, and rewards.  However, research and child development experts point to rewards as a more effective and positive strategy.

Physical punishment can have negative consequences for children.  It can lead to feelings of fear, anger, and resentment.  Children may become withdrawn or act out more in response to punishment.  More importantly, physical punishment doesn't necessarily teach children why a behavior is wrong or how to behave differently.

Positive reinforcement, through rewards, offers a more constructive approach.  When children receive praise or rewards for good behavior, it reinforces the positive behavior and makes them more likely to repeat it.  Rewards can be simple, like verbal praise or extra playtime.  They can also be more elaborate, like a special outing or a small gift.  The key is to choose rewards that are meaningful to the child.

Positive reinforcement also helps children learn the connection between their behavior and the desired outcome.  It fosters a sense of self-worth and encourages them to make good choices.

This isn't to say that there's no role for setting boundaries or consequences.  When children misbehave, it's important to communicate expectations clearly and consistently.  Taking away privileges or using timeouts can be effective consequences.  However, these techniques should be used in a calm and constructive way, focusing on teaching rather than punishing.

By focusing on positive reinforcement, parents can create a more positive and nurturing environment where children are more likely to develop good behavior and self-discipline.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").
topic : ""Do children behave better when they are physically punished or rewarded?""",1,,,
"Children are the future of the nation and how they should be raised, is a debatable issue. Some people believe that they should be exposed to physical punishment while others say constant appreciation is required for them. According to me, these arguments need proper scrutinization before forming an opinion.

To begin with, there are many advantages of conferring rewards to children. First of all, appreciation and verbal praise can have a magical impact on the behavior of the children because when they are appreciated for good conduct they come to know about the value of good behavior and try to continue with that. The more they brim with positive comments, the more they are confident. On the other hand, children who are subjected to artificial physical punishment are seen with a lack of self-confidence. A survey conducted on the behavior of children revealed that a child exposed to punitive actions by parents is more aggressive and furious than others of his age. Hence beatings of a child can never be fruitful.

On the contrary, there is no denying the fact that training the notorious and ferocious mind is a hard nut to crack because it is true that the rod is the only logic for fools. Moreover, some children repeat mistakes even after being warned and punished, this type of stubbornness forces parents and guardians to give them beatings. Needless to say, over-pampering may have an adverse effect on children. In this present scenario, parents have one or two children and this pampering distracts them away from their path.

To conclude, children are tender buds, and nurturing them is really a major responsibility. Therefore, a fair judgment on behavior is required for a good upbringing.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"Competition and cooperation are both important aspects of social development in children.  While some people believe competition is the key to success, focusing solely on winning can have downsides.  On the other hand, fostering only cooperation can leave children unprepared for a competitive world.  The ideal approach is to teach children the value of both, depending on the situation.

Competition can motivate children to push themselves, improve their skills, and strive for excellence. It can also teach them valuable lessons about goal-setting, perseverance, and dealing with disappointment.  Healthy competition can build self-confidence and a sense of accomplishment.  However, an excessive focus on winning can lead to negative consequences.  Children may become discouraged by failure, experience anxiety or frustration, and prioritize winning over good sportsmanship or teamwork.

Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children valuable social skills like communication, empathy, and compromise.  Working together towards a common goal fosters a sense of community and belonging.  Through cooperation, children learn to share resources, take turns, and resolve conflicts peacefully.  These skills are essential for success in all areas of life, not just academics.

The best approach is to help children understand when competition is appropriate and when cooperation is the better strategy.  Parents and caregivers can create opportunities for both.  Games and activities can be designed to encourage teamwork and collaboration, while also incorporating friendly competition.  It's important to emphasize effort, improvement, and learning from mistakes over winning at all costs.

By teaching children the value of both competition and cooperation, we can help them develop a well-rounded social skillset that will prepare them to be successful and responsible individuals.  They will learn to navigate competitive situations confidently while also understanding the importance of working together and supporting others.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").
topic : ""Some people say that the feeling of competition should be encouraged in children others say they should be taught to become cooperative. What is your opinion?""",1,,,
"Children are the tender buds of society and they are required to be taught the true values of life. Therefore, some people tend to believe that the feeling of competition should be infused in them while others believe that the possession of cooperative values is required of them. I will discuss the merits and demerits of both aspects before reaching any opinion.

To begin with, there are many reasons why children should have competional values. Firstly, competition motivates youngsters to accelerate their efforts to attain a higher level in education and in other activities. They start working hard to compete with others and understand the value of hard work. This dedication and hard work help them to stand first everywhere. Secondly, competional values inculcate self-confidence and self-independence in children. When they participate in activities and compete with others, they are more likely to have a feeling of self-achievement and fulfillment. They feel worthy and provide them balanced and peaceful mind. They tend to become self-reliant and that results in the best decision-making ability in them. Moreover, a sense of completion is the need of the hour. Undoubtedly, in the modern era, people their childhood till adults, face competition For example- in school, there are dance competitions, race competitions, and poem competitions and when they become adults, they face competition in taking a job while taking admission in college and even face competitive in an exam. Thus, a value is highly required.

On the other hand, it is needless to say how important is it to inculcate the value of cooperation. This is the only feeling by which a child can learn teamwork, team spirit, co-existence, tolerance, and patience. Moreover, if history is seen it becomes quite evident that the well-known icons of the society are only those who had a helping and sacrificing attitude. A self-centered human being cannot earn fame in society. Secondly, incessant preaching for competition may result in rivalry between the peer group and others. These rival feelings take no time in turning in to jealousy and personal grudges. A heart full of jealousy for others can never hold good for themselves and for others.

To conclude, after gauging both, competitional and cooperative values, I feel that both values have their own importance. Thus, a child should be brought up by imparting both equally.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"There's a big debate about how much government money should go to the arts. Some people say it's not a good use of funds, that it should go to things like education or healthcare instead. They also wonder if everyone really benefits from these programs, if they reach everyone in society.

On the other hand, there are folks who think the arts offer a lot more than just fun. They say the arts can spark creativity and new ideas, which is helpful in all sorts of fields. They can also bring people together and build a sense of community. Plus, arts programs like museums and libraries can help us hold onto our cultural heritage. And a vibrant arts scene can even boost the economy by attracting tourists and bringing in money for local businesses.

So, how much should the government spend on the arts? It's a tough question. There are always important needs competing for those resources. But the arts offer a lot in return, both for culture and society, and for the economy. Maybe the answer is finding a balance, where we support both the arts and essential services.

There are other things to consider too. Could government funding be directed towards arts programs that deal with social issues or education? Could these programs be made more accessible to everyone? Perhaps partnerships between public and private groups could help support the arts without relying solely on government money.

By thinking about all these things, and the value the arts bring, we can have a more informed conversation about how much government funding they should receive.","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"Art is the externalization of individual skills and reflects the heritage of a country. At present, art seems to have lost its value because of less concern by the government, however, I feel that art still requires being given more value than other basic necessities of any nation.

To begin with, there are many reasons why art should be the priority of any country. First of all, It is the best source of generating revenue income for the government. Museums, art galleries, and musical concerts are the places, from where a handsome revenue is taken. Mesmerizing sculptures and beautifully engraved paintings by renowned artists adorn the beauty of the museums and attract tourists. Undoubtedly, these tourists are the greatest source of revenue income. These tourists throng in large numbers on these historical places and monuments that help to promote local handicrafts, resulting in providing income to the small-scale industries.  Secondly, art is the cultural and historical reflection of every country. It is the real asset of every country that brings uniqueness and pride to every country and if a fund is not allocated by the government then it will be difficult to keep this alive.

However, some opponents of art say that spending money by a government on art hampers the development of the country in regards to good infrastructure, road system, efficient transport system, and medical facilities. Moreover, allocating money to education and medical facilities definitely lessens the literacy rate and increases the being of the nation which helps a country to grow.

To conclude, art is really an integral part of every country, therefore, the government should fund art museums and promote artists’ values to keep and maintain the glorify the history of the country otherwise artists and the art will be lost in oblivion","Write an essay about this topic (Write in only plain text. no add blod text such as ""Conclusion"").

"Technology and tradition: two things that often seem at odds.  New inventions come along, and old ways of doing things can fade away.  Some folks say that's just the natural order of things - as a country gets more tech-savvy, traditional skills and lifestyles just die out on their own.  They figure there's no point in trying to fight the inevitable.

But others disagree.  They see value in those traditions, even with all the new gadgets and gizmos.  These traditional skills can be like connections to the past, reminding people where they came from and how things used to be done.  Plus, some traditional practices might even be useful today, like ways of farming or preserving food that are sustainable and don't harm the environment.

So, is there a way to have both?  Maybe.  Maybe it's not about stopping progress completely or clinging to the past forever.  Perhaps it's about finding ways to blend the two.  Can new technology help keep traditions alive?  Could traditional skills be used in new and innovative ways?

Think about it this way: new inventions don't have to erase the old ways.  They might just change them.  And that's okay.  Traditions are living things too, and they can adapt and evolve just like anything else.  The important thing is to keep the conversation going, to figure out how much of the past we want to carry with us into the future.","Write an essay about this topic (he text should be ""Natually Connected"".

"Technology is flourishing by leaps and bounds and undoubtedly this advancement is taking a toll on traditional values. I do believe that in this technological world, traditional values are bound to disappear.

To begin with, there are many reasons why these conventional values have no existence in this modern world. First of all, In this fast-paced world, everyone is assisted with the mobile phone to stay connected with their family and friends. However, in olden times people used to send letters and stand in long queues on S.T.D and I.S.D just for the maturity of one call.  This advancement in the modes of communication has proved that traditional skills are worth nothing. Secondly, technology has transformed the world of fashion. Earlier people used to do knitting, stitching, and designing manually but now machines have made every task easier and comfortable. To substantiate my view, many fashion designing students were seen portraying pictures of models themselves for checking the compatibility of colors but at present, this work is done in seconds on multifarious advanced software. Apart from this, hardly anyone is seen purchasing pitchers for cool water because of the invention of refrigerators.

"Artists are kind of like explorers, venturing into the unknown to create new and interesting things. To do that, they need some freedom to roam around and experiment. That's why most folks agree artists need at least some space to develop their creativity.

But where do we draw the line? Some people believe artists should be able to express absolutely anything they want, no holds barred. They say restrictions stifle creativity and prevent artists from pushing boundaries.

Others worry that complete freedom can lead to expressions that are harmful or offensive. They argue that some ideas might be better left unsaid, and that artists should consider the impact of their work on others.

So, is there a happy medium? Maybe. Perhaps artists need freedom to explore, but also a sense of responsibility for what they create. Think of it like a playground with a few rules. Kids can run around and use their imaginations, but there are boundaries in place to keep everyone safe and having fun.

Maybe finding that balance is key.  We can support artistic freedom while also having conversations about the role and responsibility of artists in society.

"Art is the externalization of the skills of an artist. Therefore, there are people who are in favor of imparting full liberty to the artists; however, others oppose this opinion freely. In my opinion, freedom is necessary up to a greater extent but there should be proper surveillance on their work to avoid any unpleasant situation.

To begin with, there are many reasons why some people are in favor of giving full freedom to artists. First of all, if they are free from any suppression that helps them to unveil all the social issues of the society without any fear. They expose the cancerous spot and request that society uproot that. Any type of confinement will not let them express their thoughts. Secondly, these creative artists are the nerve of every nation because of their extraordinary skills; if they work freely they, undoubtedly, have the potential to make a masterpiece that brings recognition to every country on the map of the world.

However, I feel that full autonomy may have an adverse effect on the individual and on society because many times artists are seen painting an objectionable picture, adding any anti-social dialogue in the films that results in communal riots and hurts the sentiments of the people. These types of acts cost the lives of the people. For example, once in the popular film, some Hindu gods are shown begging. This film has not only brought criticism by the Hindu society but also sparked communal riots that have ended up in the demise of some people. Therefore, they should not be given full freedom.

To sum up, although artists are required to be given full liberty to explore their creativity yet government should ensure that that very act may not hurt others' feelings.","Write an essay about this topic (he text should be ""Natually Connected"". Not in a organized form).

"Art class in school: some folks see it as a magical land of creativity and self-expression, while others wonder if it's just messy finger painting and pointless singing. So, what's the deal? Is art a must-have subject, or a skippable extra?

Those who champion art in schools say it's about more than just making cool pictures or learning the recorder. They say art classes can spark imagination and help kids develop problem-solving skills. Plus, working on a creative project can be a nice break from math problems and history lectures. Art can also bring people together, letting kids collaborate and build friendships.

But some folks argue that there just isn't enough time in the school day for everything, and that maybe art should be sacrificed for subjects like science or math. They worry that art class might not directly prepare kids for future careers.

So, is there a middle ground? Maybe! Perhaps art classes could be designed to be more relevant to other subjects, like incorporating science concepts into art projects. Or maybe there could be art clubs or after-school programs for kids who are super interested.

Ultimately, the value of art class might depend on the individual kid. Some students might thrive in a creative environment, while others might prefer to focus on different subjects.

"There has always been a raging debate about whether art is an important subject for children in schools or whether it can be neglected in the views of other important subjects. I am going to scrutinize both aspects in further paragraphs before forming an opinion in the last.

To begin with, on the one side of the coin, there are many reasons for supporting other important subjects in children’s school curriculum; firstly, modern technology like computer literacy has become the need of the hour.  It is one of the most demanded skills for a job in every sector.  If they spend most of their time in learning art they will not be able to face the cut-throat competition of this scenario. Moreover, the knowledge of essential subjects like math, and science is highly required in every field. Secondly, Art despite being highly appreciated, still does not ensure any career growth because most of the fields like engineering, marketing, IT professionals, and managers are a found graduated and post graduated in these important subjects.

On the other flip side of the coin, art is a creative skill that has wonderful imagination power. It provides the wings to the fantasy and expresses the feelings without the exchange of words. To illustrate, I have come across a painting in which the difference between the rich and poor’s plight was depicted through painting only. Moreover, music is also a piece of art and works as a healing therapy in the hectic world.  Secondly, artists bring laurels for the country across the world and ensure that the cultural heritage of the country may not be extinct.  For this, they are highly paid and appreciated.  That kind of respect is no less than a flourished career.  To conclude, in my view, the selection of the subjects should be left to the students in which they are interested because that very interest helps them to grow in their life.","topic : ""Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Social media, texting, apps... technology has totally changed the way we connect with each other.  On the one hand, it's made staying in touch with friends and family way easier, no matter where they are in the world. We can share updates, funny videos, or even just quick hellos with just a few taps.

This can be especially helpful for people who are geographically distant or have busy lives.  For example, a college student might video chat with their parents every week, even if they live in another state.  Or a group of friends who all work crazy hours can stay connected through a group chat, sharing memes and making plans for the weekend.

Technology can also be a great way to meet new people with similar interests.  There are online communities for everything these days, from sports fans to dog lovers to bookworms.  People can connect and chat with others who share their passions, which can be a great way to build new friendships.

However, there's a downside too.  Sometimes all this tech can make face-to-face interaction feel awkward or even unnecessary.  We might spend so much time texting with someone that we forget how to have a real conversation.  Also, social media can create a highlight reel of everyone's lives, which can be discouraging if you're comparing your everyday life to someone else's best moments.

In my own experience, I've noticed that it's easy to get sucked into a social media scroll and forget about the people who are physically around me.  I've had to make a conscious effort to put my phone down and actually talk to my friends when we're hanging out.

So, is all this technology a positive or negative development?  I think it's a mixed bag.  It's a powerful tool for connection, but it's important to use it mindfully.   Maybe the key is finding a balance – staying connected virtually, but also making time for real-life interactions where we can have deeper conversations and build stronger relationships.","Write an essay about this topic (he text should be ""Natually Connected"".

Many experts are debating the sweet spot for learning languages: primary school or secondary school? Proponents of starting young say it gives kids a head start. Their brains are like sponges, absorbing new information quickly. Plus, younger kids might not be as self-conscious about making mistakes, which can be a big hurdle for language learners. Imagine a playground full of kids trying out new words and phrases in another language – it can be a fun and pressure-free way to learn.

But some folks worry that starting too early might take away from other important subjects. Maybe a young child's brain isn't quite ready for the complexities of another language.  There's also the question of motivation – will little kids really be interested in learning verb conjugations or grammatical rules?

So, is there a happy medium? Maybe! Some schools offer introductory language programs in primary school that focus on basic vocabulary and pronunciation, like learning how to greet someone or count to ten.  This can spark an interest in languages and get kids comfortable with the idea before diving deeper in secondary school.

topic : ""Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages?""",1,,,
"It is true that language acquisition is a complex process. Therefore, it is advisable to teach a foreign language at elementary school rather than secondary. According to me, the merits of this notion outnumbered its demerits.

To embark on, there are numerous benefits of teaching a foreign language to children at an early age. First of all, children have a receptive mind with good grasping power. This age is the learning stage of life. Whatever is learned in childhood, can remember longer in life. Besides that, children are less egoistic and are not afraid of committing a mistake in learning. As failures are the pillars of success while continuous practicing they may attain a reasonable level of language. Undoubtedly, a language consists of different dialects, grammatical rules, intonations, denotation, functions syntax, and style. By practicing these, a child can possess unmatchable linguistic skills. Secondly, everyone is in a mad race to fly board in this modern scenario, and possession of a foreign language equips them to communicate freely for easy survival. Moreover, polished communication skills have become a need for the hour of the cutthroat competitive world.
